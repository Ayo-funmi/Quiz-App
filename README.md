# Quiz App


## Getting Started
 This is a quiz app created using Flutter/Dart. It contains a total of three screens-the welcome screen(where a user inputs their name to get started), the question screen(there are a total of ten questions with four options each. The option turns green if correct, otherwise, it turns red), the score screen(where the total score is displayed).
